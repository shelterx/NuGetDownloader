# NuGetDownloader
Download a local NuGet repository with PowerShell

This is a fixed version of the Nuget Downloader by Jon Galloway
Microsoft is referring to his script in their Windows Admin Center documentation, however the script did not work so I fixed it.

The script can be used to download Nuget packages (.npkg) from Nuget feeds.
For Windows Admin Center it comes in handy for offline Windows Admin installations when you need a local "repository" of the WAC extensions so they can be installed/updated.

(I did not spend much time on it, I know it can be improved.)
